        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            I was born in China and raised in Mexico. I moved to the United States as an unaccompanied child at the age of 16, in 2016, with the goal 
            of acquiring a better education and professional opportunities. After years of hard work, and thanks to the help of the great people 
            I have had around me, I managed to graduate from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science last May of 2023. Due to my immigration status, 
            I have struggled to land a job, but I am currently working on acquiring the necessary skills to become a full stack developer and work 
            as an independent contractor or join the CTD Apprenticeship Program. In my free time I like to hang out with friends, work out, play video games, 
            and explore the city.
